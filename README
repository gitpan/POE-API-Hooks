NAME
    POE::API::Hooks - Implement lightweight hooks into POE

SYNOPSIS
      use POE;
      use POE::API::Hooks;

      POE::API::Hooks->add(
          before_event_dispatch  => \&do_something,
          after_event_dispatch   => \&do_something,
          before_session_create  => \&do_something,
          after_session_create   => \&do_something,
          before_event_enqueue   => \&do_something,
          after_event_enqueue    => \&do_something,
      );

      # ... carry on with life as normal ...

DISCUSSION
    This module adds lightweight hooks into the inner workings of POE.
    Currently, one can add hooks into POE that get called before/after an
    event is dispatched, before/after a Session is created, and/or
    before/after an event is enqueued. These callbacks receive the exact
    same argument list as their Kernel/Session counterpart. For event
    dispatch related callbacks, see "_dispatch_event" and "_data_ev_enqueue"
    in POE::Kernel. For session related callbacks, see "create" in
    POE::Session.

BUGS
    When $_[KERNEL]->call($_[SESSION], "event") is used, _event_dispatch is
    bypassed. This is an optimization, not a bug, but it will cause the
    event_dispatch hook to be bypassed under this condition. Someone relying
    on the event_dispatch hook may call this a bug.

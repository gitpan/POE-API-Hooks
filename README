NAME
    POE::API::Hooks - Implement lightweight hooks into POE

SYNOPSIS
      use POE;
      use POE::API::Hooks;

      POE::API::Hooks->add(
          before_event_dispatch  => \&do_something,
          after_event_dispatch   => \&do_something,
          before_session_create  => \&do_something,
          after_session_create   => \&do_something,
      );

      # ... carry on with life as normal ...

DISCUSSION
    This module adds lightweight hooks into the inner workings of POE.
    Currently, one can add hooks into POE that get called before/after an
    event is dispatched and/or before/after a Session is created. These
    callbacks receive the exact same argument list as their Kernel/Session
    counterpart. For event dispatch related callbacks, see "_dispatch_event"
    in POE::Kernel. For session related callbacks, see "create" in
    POE::Session.
